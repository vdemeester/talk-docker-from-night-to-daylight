# Hands-on n.1

The goal here is to build an elasticsearch image and run it.

To do this you will have to:

1. Complete the ``Dockerfile``, there is tips in there
2. Run the build command :

```bash
$ docker build -t my/elasticsearch
```
3. If everything has gone well, let's run some with ``docker run``.
   Run them it detach mode ``-d`` and bind port with ``-p``
