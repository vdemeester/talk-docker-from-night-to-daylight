# Docker : From night to Daylight

This repository is the sources of a talk I gave at
[Zenika](http://www.zenika.com), the 22th of June.

The idea is dense presentation with hands-on to introduce
[Docker](http://docker.com), what it does and how to use it. We also
talk about [Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose),
[Swarm](https://github.com/docker/swarm) and
[Machine](https://github.com/docker/machine), and some cool demos
``:-P``.
