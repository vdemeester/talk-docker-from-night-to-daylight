# Hands-on n.2

The goal here is to run ``flask-by-example`` stack using
``docker-compose``.

To do this you will have to :

1. Clone the ``flask-by-example`` repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:vdemeester/flask-by-example.git
```

2. Complete the ``docker-compose.yml``, there is tips in there
3. Build it using ``docker-compose build``
4. If everything went well, run the stack with ``docker-compose up``
5. And go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the result.
